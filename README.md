Project - QUIZ GAME

Objective : The objective of the project is to develop a simple quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to the user. The game should keep track of the user's score and provide feedback based on their answers.

Key Activities :

Here are the key activities in developing a simple quiz game in C++:

1. Question Data Structure: Define a struct or class to store questions, options, and answers.
2. Game Loop: Create a loop to repeatedly ask questions until the game ends.
3. Display Question: Display the current question and its options.
4. Get User Input: Get the user's answer and validate it.
5. Check Answer: Compare the user's answer with the correct answer.
6. Update Score: Increment the score if the answer is correct.
7. Provide Feedback: Display feedback based on the user's answer.
8. End Game: End the game after a set number of questions or when the user quits.

   
Technologies Used :

C++ Programming Laguage - Primary programming language used.


Key Insights :

Here are the key insights in developing a simple quiz game in C++:

Functional Insights

1. Modularize Code: Organize code into functions for question display, user input, answer checking, and score tracking.
2. Use Data Structures: Utilize arrays or vectors to store questions, options, and answers.
3. Implement Game Loop: Use a loop to repeatedly ask questions until the game ends.
4. Validate User Input: Ensure user input is within the valid range of options.

Non-Functional Insights

1. Readability: Use clear and concise code for easy maintenance.
2. Efficiency: Optimize code for performance and minimize unnecessary computations.
3. User Experience: Provide timely and relevant feedback to the user.

Data Insights

1. Question Data: Store questions, options, and correct answers in a structured format.
2. User Data: Track user scores and answers for feedback and evaluation.

User Insights

1. User Engagement: Make the game engaging and challenging for the user.
2. User Feedback: Provide clear and constructive feedback for correct and incorrect answers.

Technical Insights

1. C++ Standard Library: Utilize C++ standard library functions for input/output, strings, and data structures.
2. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms for invalid user input and unexpected errors.
